This is a Greasemonkey script for web interface of Wanscam ip cams. It unlocks all functions avaible only on IE and many extra features.

1. I used Firefox 47.0 and HW0045 camera (software version V6.6.8.1.1-20160310, webware version E200.0.45.21), possibly this script will work with other Wanscam cameras and browsers, but it is totaly UNTESTED.
2. This script unlocks all features from IE but some of them will not work on non-IE browser, like multi-camera view or most of main page hidden right side buttons, perhaps it will all work on IE7pro or other IE user script compatible stuff, but it is untested for now.
3. Some unlocked features may not work on any browser, there is a possibility that You can even brick Your camera by changing one of unlocked hidden settings, i did not tested them all, so: !!!CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED AND USE THIS SOFTWARE ON YOUR OWN RISK!!!
4. All unlocked features except main page buttons are marked with Yellow background to warn the user.
5. To use audio on non-audio outdoor devices You have to connect your own speaker and microphone to camera, usualy there is a 2-pin connector for each of them inside.
6. There are 2 repeated hidden features in Video Settings cart, one in Record Settings and one in motion detection cart, i skipped them.
7. Tested functionality for now:
    Zoom:works
    Focus:works
    Digital zoom: don't work on Firefox
    Multi-camera view buttons:don't work on Firefox.
    Main page side buttons: Only record playback button works on Firefox.
    Maintain>Backup setting data:You can download configuration file but i did not tryied to restore it. There is a possibility of device bricking.
    Motion detection: Seems to work fine with FF.
    Video mask: Seems to work fine with FF.
    Image settings>Advanced>Night model: Checkbox saves with Apply button but i don't see any diffrence.
